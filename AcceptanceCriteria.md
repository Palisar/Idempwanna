# Idempotency Package - Acceptance Criteria

## Overview
This document outlines the acceptance criteria for a .NET 9 NuGet package that provides idempotency support for ASP.NET applications. The package will help ensure that operations can be safely retried without unintended side effects.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Basic Functionality
- [ ] Support for marking HTTP endpoints as idempotent via attributes
- [ ] Automatic handling of duplicate requests with the same idempotency key
- [ ] Configurable idempotency key handling (header, query parameter, or custom)
- [ ] Support for both synchronous and asynchronous endpoints
- [ ] Automatic response caching for successful operations

### 2. Caching Integration
- [ ] Extensible caching system with multiple provider support
- [ ] Built-in support for:
  - [ ] In-memory caching
  - [ ] Distributed caching (Redis, SQL Server, etc.)  
  - [ ] Hybrid caching
- [ ] Configurable cache duration
- [ ] Cache key generation strategies

### 3. Request/Response Handling
- [ ] Automatic detection of duplicate requests
- [ ] Proper HTTP status code handling (e.g., 200 OK for duplicates, 201 Created for new operations)
- [ ] Support for custom response serialization
- [ ] Request/response logging for debugging

### 4. Configuration
- [ ] Fluent API for easy setup
- [ ] Default configuration with sensible defaults
- [ ] Environment-based configuration support
- [ ] Health check integration

### 5. Error Handling
- [ ] Clear error messages for common issues
- [ ] Custom exception types for idempotency-related errors
- [ ] Support for custom error handling strategies
- [ ] Logging integration

### 6. Performance
- [ ] Minimal performance overhead
- [ ] Thread-safe implementation
- [ ] Efficient caching strategies
- [ ] Support for high-throughput scenarios

### 7. Security
- [ ] Secure handling of idempotency keys
- [ ] Protection against key guessing attacks
- [ ] Support for key expiration policies
- [ ] Integration with ASP.NET Core's authentication/authorization

### 8. Testing
- [ ] FluentAssertions, XUnit, NSubstitute
- [ ] Test coverage > 80% in the Core Project
- [ ] Integration test suite
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Sample applications
- [ ] Documentation

## Non-Goals
- Replacing existing caching solutions
- Providing full API gateway functionality
- Handling distributed transactions

## Future Considerations
- Support for gRPC services
- Integration with OpenTelemetry
- Advanced rate limiting features
- Support for other .NET platforms (e.g., Xamarin, MAUI)

## Success Metrics
- Easy integration into existing ASP.NET Core applications
- Minimal performance impact
- Clear documentation and examples
- High test coverage
- Positive community feedback
